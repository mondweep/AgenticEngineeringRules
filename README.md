# SPARC Agentic Engineering Rules

This repository contains the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) Agentic Engineering Rules for developing software using AI agents and human collaboration.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Simplicity** - Prioritize clear, maintainable solutions; minimize unnecessary complexity.
2. **Iteration** - Enhance existing code unless fundamental changes are clearly justified.
3. **Focus** - Stick strictly to defined tasks; avoid unrelated scope changes.
4. **Quality** - Deliver clean, well-tested, documented, and secure outcomes through structured workflows.
5. **Collaboration** - Foster effective teamwork between human developers and autonomous agents.

## Methodology & Workflow

The SPARC workflow consists of five key phases:
- **Specification** - Define clear objectives, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- **Pseudocode** - Map logical implementation before coding
- **Architecture** - Design modular components with clear boundaries
- **Refinement** - Implement with TDD, debugging, and optimization
- **Completion** - Integrate, document, test, and verify

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the rules, guidelines and configurations for integrating AI agents into the development workflow.

### File Organization

- `.roo/`: Contains rule definitions for different development stages and scenarios
- `.cursorrules` and `.windsurfrules`: Configuration files for AI code assistants
- `LICENSE`: MIT license file
- Various markdown files documenting the SPARC methodology and implementation details
